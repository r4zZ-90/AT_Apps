Apps for Animation Throwdown.

How to get it running?

The software you need to download is for free.
1. Download and install R (https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html - choose any mirror you want)
2. Download and install RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)
3. Open the script with RStudio
4. Install the packages that get loaded in the top of the script (this step only needs to be done once)
4.1 To install packages just type in the console in RStudio: install.packages("your_package")
5. Insert your ID and hashed password in the right place (Check for DATA section, I commented on it)
5.1 If you're not VIP you should probably adjust "limit" too (I commented it too)
6. Run the app (top right corner - green triangle that says "Run app")

That's it.
